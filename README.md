# TabbedListChamber Example App

This app demonstrates the TabbedListChamber. It contains several pre-defined tabs, including a tab that fetches data from an included Nodejs server. For this to work, the server must be running locally. Instructions on how to start the server are included in the **Installation** section.

## Installation
1. Download the app, unzip it, and move it to your workspace folder.
2. Switch to the **master** or **cadence-release** branch in ividev. If you need to access features currently in development, use the **tabbed-list-chamber** branch.
3. Navigate to the downloaded app's directory in your Terminal or Command Prompt, and enter **node index** to start the local Nodejs server.
4. Select **tabbed-list-chamber** from the launch app/workspace menu in the simulator.
