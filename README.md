# TabbedListChamber Example App

This app demonstrates the TabbedListChamber in its current state. It contains several pre-defined tabs, including a tab that fetches data from an included Nodejs server. For this to work, the server must be running locally. Instructions on how to start the server are included in the **Installation** section.

## Installation
1. Download the app, unzip it, and move it to your workspace folder.
2. Switch to the **tabbed-list-chamber** branch in ividev.
3. Navigate to the downloaded app's directory in your Terminal or Command Prompt, and enter **node index** to start the local Nodejs server.
4. Select **tabbed-list-chamber** from the launch app/workspace menu in the simulator.

## Caveats
1. The Tabbed List Chamber that backs this app is currently in an alpha state, so unexpected behavior may occur. 
2. The list hijacks the commander focus, so it's difficult to use the commander to navigate the tabs.
